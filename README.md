in the terminal set your current directory to the directory of your setup script and run the script and the script will guide you through the process
of setting the menu up to use 

all of your files will download to wherever your setup script is so ideally put your setup script in a folder called "Program" or some

command line:

```
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh # flags (-n nosleep will run through the script at full sleep -v verbose will output everything to the terminal you're in) 
```
