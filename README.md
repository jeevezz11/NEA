Make sure that you open the correct folder in your terminal when executing

run the setup.sh script in your desired terminal

Change the program directory to wherever your "Program" file is located on your device in the "config.ini" file

This is essential for the program to work so ensure it is done correctly
The easiest way to do this is to locate the file and copy and paste the path 

Once your config.ini file is set run the 'Menu.sh' and that's it should work from there
create a menu.sh shortcut where necessary to fit your needs

Here is a list of error codes and what to try:

1 - you still have the default file path in the 'config.ini' file and it needs to be changed to your own directory

2 - An unknown error has occured when attempting to start a new order, just ensure that the correct directory is set in the 'config.ini' file and it should be in the format 'programFolder: /path/to/your/directory/'

3 - You have more than 4 orders currently open and it is reccomending you don't take on any more to manage your workload

4 - There aren't any active orders currently open, usually okay just open an order and it should appear there but if it doesn't ensure your 'config.ini' is pointing to the correct file

5 - It is unable tot find the active orders to view, ensure the 'config.ini' file is pointing to the correct directory

6 - The admin password you've entered is incorrect, don't forget your password

7 - The date you're trying to get receipts for doesn't have any reciepts

8 - There may be a problem with the code, I suggest you redownload the latest version from github

9 - Same as 8
